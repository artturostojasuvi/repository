# import Madoff-data to R
madoffdata <- read.table(file.choose(), header = T)


# Show the Madoff-data
madoffdata

# Doesn't seem to show all the data 

# What is our "max.print"?
getOption("max.print")

# Let's change max.print to a greater value than before
options(max.print = 9999999)

# Now we can see all the data
madoffdata

# Let's create a new column for market return, let's call it "rm"
madoffdata$rm <- madoffdata$rmrf + madoffdata$rf 

# Let's print madoffdata out again
madoffdata

# In how many months rm is positive?
rm_positive <- nrow(madoffdata[madoffdata$rm>0,])

rm_positive

# As a result we get 136 months out of 215 (market return) were above zero

# Next: In how many months was the return of Fairfield Sentry fund positive?
fsl_positive <- nrow(madoffdata[madoffdata$fsl>0,])

fsl_positive

# As a result, 198 fsl values out of 215 were positive 

# Next question: In how many months fsl outperformed rm?

# Let's add a column in which we see the remainder of fsl and rm
madoffdata$fslorm <- madoffdata$fsl - madoffdata$rm

madoffdata

# Then we can count how many of fsrorm values are positive:
fsl_outperformed <- nrow(madoffdata[madoffdata$fslorm>0,])

fsl_outperformed

# And we get: fsl outperformed market return on 95 months out of 215.

rm_outperformed <-nrow(madoffdata[madoffdata$fslorm<0,])

rm_outperformed

# By the same way we get that market return outperformed fsl on 120 months

# fsl outperformed as a percentage of months:
fslorm_percentage <- fsl_outperformed/nrow(madoffdata)

fslorm_percentage

# rm outperformed as a percentage of months:
rmofsl_percentage <- rm_outperformed/nrow(madoffdata)

# ASSIGNMENT 1B 
# Sample average of fslrf (Fairfield's excess returns)
fslrf_mean <- mean(madoffdata$fslrf)

fslrf_mean

# Let's check if our result is correct:
fslrf_sum <- sum(madoffdata$fslrf)

fslrf_sum

fslrf_mean_check <- fslrf_sum/nrow(madoffdata)

fslrf_mean_check

# Mean of Fairfield's excess returns: 0,52

# YES! We got it correct!

# Next: Let's calculate the standard deviation of fslrf

fslrf_sd <- sd(madoffdata$fslrf)

fslrf_sd

# Standard deviation of Fairfield's excess returns: 0,69

# Now we may calculate the Sharpe ratio for Fairfield's stock

fairfield_sharpe <- fslrf_mean/fslrf_sd

fairfield_sharpe

# Sharpe ratio of Fairfield: 0,76

# Next we'll calculate the avg and sd of market excess returns
rmrf_mean <- mean(madoffdata$rmrf)

rmrf_mean

# Mean of the excess market returns: 0,48

# What is the standard deviation of excess market returns?

rmrf_sd <- sd(madoffdata$rmrf)

rmrf_sd

# We get: 4,2

# Let's then calculate the sharpe ratio for market returns
market_sharpe <- rmrf_mean/rmrf_sd

market_sharpe

# We get: 0,11

# RESULTS: 
# Did Fairfield outperform the market (avgreturns): YES
# Was Fairfield riskier than the market (sd): NO
# Did Fairfield outperform market based on sharpe?: YES
